# IT0043.FINAL.PROJECT
The website created has no affiliations with Mixue. This is solely for educational purposes.  
The task for the final project is either to create our own website or create our own version of one business known in the Philippines.  
We cannot download and use a template from the internet. Furthermore, it was recommended that we can use only HTML, CSS, and JS as these are the focus of the course.  
We may either use the web design layout techniques and design trends discussed as a reference for redesigning the website.  
The website should be stored in a web server so that anyone can access it.
